Hi — I’m Anne-Lise, a neuroscience PhD and applied data scientist.

I build measurement + analysis pipelines that turn real-world human data (behavior, sensory experience, text) into interpretable outcomes — and translate findings into product-ready insights for personalized health and nutrition.

Pinned projects:
- DeepFooding-CDL — quantify eating behavior from meal videos (pose tracking → events/features)
- Chatbot_Wine_Memory — semi-structured interviews to capture memorable food/wine experiences as analyzable data
- Wine_tasting_KG — clean ~130k reviews and build a knowledge graph linking descriptors, regions, and ratings
