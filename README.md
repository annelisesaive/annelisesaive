Hi! I’m Anne-Lise, a neuroscience PhD and applied data scientist.

I build measurement + analysis pipelines that turn real-world human data (behavior, sensory experience, text) into interpretable outcomes — and translate findings into product-ready insights for personalized health and nutrition.

Pinned projects:
- [DeepFooding](https://github.com/annelisesaive/DeepFooding-CDL) — quantify eating behavior from meal videos (pose tracking → events/features)
- [Memorable Scents](https://github.com/jltt-grc/memorable_scents) - ML and stat pipeline for odor memorability modeling (paper linked)
- [Chatbot_Wine_Memory](https://github.com/annelisesaive/Chatbot_Wine_Memory) — semi-structured interviews to decode and characterize food/wine experiences
- [Wine_tasting_KG](https://github.com/annelisesaive/Wine_tasting_KG) — clean ~130k reviews and build a knowledge graph linking descriptors, regions, and ratings
